# Galaxy Simulator

## Overview

Galaxy Simulator is a physics-based simulation of celestial bodies and their gravitational interactions. The project models planetary orbits and visualizes motion using JavaFX.

## Features

- **Realistic Orbital Simulation**: Implements gravity-based movement of celestial bodies.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays planetary motion in real-time using JavaFX.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Accurately calculates gravitational forces and orbital paths.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure the following are installed:

- **Java 17 or later**
- **JavaFX** (Ensure JavaFX is properly configured in your Java environment)
